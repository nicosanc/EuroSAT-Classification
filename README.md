# Introduction

To showcase my understanding of a popular Deep Learning framework and the Deep Learning Basics,
I decided on building a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images, using PyTorch. I trained and tested the model 
on the CIFAR10 dataset offered by torchvision.datasets. The model was trained several times with different 
data augmentations to try and improve the model&apos;s generalization. It was tested against unshuffled, un-augmented validation and test 
sets.
